`:is()` and `:where()` are CSS functional pseudo-classes introduced in the Selectors Level 4 specification. They allow you to create more concise and maintainable CSS code by grouping selectors and applying styles to them.

## _:is()_ Selector Function

The `:is()` selector function is used to apply a set of styles to a group of selectors. It takes a list of selectors as its argument and matches elements that match any of the selectors in the list.

Here is an example:

```css
:is(header, footer) a:hover {
	color: green;
	text-decoration: underline;
}
```

In this example, the `:is()` selector function is used to apply the `a:hover` styles to the `<header>` and `<footer>` elements.

## _:where()_ Selector Function

The `:where()` selector function is similar to `:is()` selector function, but it has a different specificity value. The `:where()` selector function has a specificity value of zero, which makes it easier to override styles.

## Example with Tags;

```css
:where(article, section, aside) {
	color: gray;
}

article {
	color: red;
}
```

In this example, the `:where()` selector function is used to apply the `color: gray` style to the `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<aside>` elements. However, if you apply a different `color` style to the `<article>` element, it will take precedence over the `:where()` selector function.

## Example with classes;

```css
:is(.info, .notice) {
	color: red;
	font-weight: bold;
}
```

In this example, the `:is()` selector function is used to apply the `color: red` and `font-weight: bold` styles to elements that have the `.info` or `.notice` class.

Similarly, the `:where()` selector function is used to apply styles to a group of selectors with a specificity value of zero. So, you can use `:where()` to apply styles to multiple class selectors without worrying about their specificity.

Here is an example:

```css
:where(.info, .notice) {
	color: red;
	font-weight: bold;
}
```

In this example, the `:where()` selector function is used to apply the `color: red` and `font-weight: bold` styles to elements that have the `.info` or `.notice` class. The specificity value of `:where()` is zero, so it will not override other styles with higher specificity.

> Note that both `:is()` and `:where()` selector functions can take a list of class selectors as their argument, separated by commas. Also, you can use them with any other selectors, not just class or tag selectors.

## Browser Support

Both `:is()` and `:where()` selector functions are supported in all modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Opera. However, it is not supported in Internet Explorer (obviously ðŸ˜…).

## Conclusion

The `:is()` and `:where()` selector functions are powerful CSS functional pseudo-classes that can help you create more concise and maintainable CSS code. They are supported in all modern browsers, but they are not supported in Internet Explorer.
