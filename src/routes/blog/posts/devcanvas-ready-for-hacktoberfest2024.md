The summer of open source is here! It's that magical time of year when contributions flow in like never before, and the open-source community buzzes with excitement. The month where maintainers and open source enthusiast go nuts, either from too much spam contributions, or really good contributions accelerating the software at an unprecedented speed. Either way, Devcanvas is here for it (not for the spams though ðŸ« ).

SvelteKit is our framework of choice, offering a powerful and efficient way to build web applications. It provides a smooth developer experience with its component-based architecture and built-in routing system, state management, transitions and all. Contributing to DevCanvas is an excellent opportunity to experience how sweet Svelte makes building web apps.

**Supabase**

For our backend needs, we leverage Supabase, an open-source Firebase alternative. It provides real-time databases, authentication, instant APIs, and easy storage management.

We use Tailwind CSS to style the user interface. This utility-first CSS framework allows for rapid UI development without leaving your HTML. If you're interested in frontend styling and creating responsive, beautiful interfaces, you'll have plenty of opportunities to work with Tailwind in DevCanvas.
